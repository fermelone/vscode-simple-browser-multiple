# Simple Browser Multi

This is a modified version of VS Code's built-in Simple Browser extension that allows opening multiple browser instances simultaneously.

## Features

- Open multiple browser windows at the same time
- Each browser window operates independently
- All other features of the original Simple Browser are preserved

## Usage

Use the command "Simple Browser: Show" to open a new browser window. Each time you run this command, a new browser window will open.

## Differences from the original Simple Browser

The original Simple Browser extension only allows one browser window to be open at a time. If you try to open a new URL, it will reuse the existing window. This modified version creates a new window each time.

## License

This extension is licensed under the MIT License, same as the original VS Code repository.
